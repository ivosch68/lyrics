E                                                                                A
 The summer starts and the weather's nice, everybody's going out
E                                                                       A                        b   
Meeting friends  and having fun, thats what it is all about
A                                                                                        E
Sitting in the sun and feeling how your skin gets brown
A                                                                     b
Hang around at the beach and some tits are also shown

There are a barbecues at the backyards but you will never go there
You go down in your basement and close the curtains everywhere
 
Sure, you have friends and you are also good at school
But the sun is too hot and you are not a fool

Refrain
E                      b                                     c#                    G# 
Sun is shining, nights are warm but this is not for you 
A               e                         b
Summer in the Basement

All your friends are having fun, and celebrate their lifes
Summer in the Basement

Intro über Strophe

Strophe
it is too warm, you are sweating fast, why should you go out in the heat, 
In your basement it is cold, and here - you have everything you need

fast food, Snacks and your high end pc is cooling down, 
Your mom brings you food and stuff, your seat looks like a throne

Why should you fly for hours to other countries and poison in the air
When you can start your machine and go right everywhere

You will travel, visit deserts, hills and cities too
It will be a great adventure, where you go, you need no shoes

Refrain
It is okay to sit at home, don't care what others say 
Summer in the basement

You can play games all day long, and celebrate your life
Summer in the basement
