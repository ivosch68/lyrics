Refrain:
Cookies all around me â€“ Opt in Opt out yeah
Cookies all around

Str. 1
It's the most wonderfull time of the day 
Hang my self into the web
Have to wait  the 56K
Load the pages bit by bit

These were the days when all the 
web was polite and honest 
Nothing but the truth was yet to load

Now that Dataprivacy eats 
Fucking UX For breakfast
There's onyl kitten and memes on speed

Str. 2
It's most wonderful time of the day
Scrolling towards timelines end
New definition of infinty
Repeating post no relevance

Bits and bytes became gossip
Information bubble
Nothing new nothing to see

Algorithms feed me
On the breast of social
Troling 'round the christmas tree
