Be my memory out of bounds exception
Be my Blue screen of death - yeah - I need you



Str. 1
Your the reason for this text and for these chords
Remember when it all began
Learned from failures scratched head and start debugging
Again and again

First lines in my IDE I thought I did it 
on first take
But truth got me by the balls it crashed production
For god's sake


Str. 2
CI/CD is just for loosers when you code on the 
Productive side of live
Fucked it up not only once 
It was not me who paid the price

ZT:
Travel through time and space 
With the code I'm writing now
Let's compile and see...
