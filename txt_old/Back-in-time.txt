d 
It was in late nineteen eighty five,
A
when a young Guy and his doctor took a drive 
d
At the Twin Pine Mall in the parking lot
A
There came bad guys and there was a shot
E
So that was the end 
A
of Emmet Brown
E
Adventure began
A
for Marty McFly


The Doctor had a fancy car
and he tought he will be a science star

He showed Marty what his car can do
And Marty was blown out off his shoe

Its a time machine
In a fancy car

It can travel in time
when you are fast enough

Strophe
-----------------------------------------------

It was in late nineteen fifty five
when a farmboy saw him arrive
 
he had a visit at the twin pine farm
he drove straight into the farmers barn

Flames on the street
and Ice on the car

Marty drove away
But he hit a pine


one point twenty one giga watt
Tommy Addison, this is a lot

Marty planned his travel back with young DocBrown
There was a lightning and a clock in town
If  you wanna go back
you will need some help

eighty eight miles
and a lightning bolt

Refrain 2x

Back in Time
Flames on the street

Back in Time
and Ice on the car

Back in Time
Its a time machine
