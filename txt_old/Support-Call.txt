Hi, is there the support hotline - aha
I got a problem with a laptop of mine - aha
It shuts down every now and then - aha
I tried a lot already but it’s doing it again - aha


I checked the internet and I found a few - aha
suggestions how to fix it and some “how to”s - aha
I found the registry I felt like a hacker or so - aha
But nothing solved it since it happened two weeks ago

Did you say I have to switch it off? - aha
But now I can't  see a lot – aha
I think you talk shit I know it better than you -aha
I cant belive it and it cant be true -aha

This stinking guy really helped me a lot - aha
But I bet he looks very odd -aha
The reboot starts and the system seems brand new - aha
 Are you someone from the informatics crew? - Yeahhh
