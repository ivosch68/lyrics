She was a fast machine, she kept her memory clean
She had the best damn cpu that I ever seen
She had the sightless eyes, telling me no lies
Knocking me out with those American thighs

Taking more than her share, had me fighting for air
She told me to come, but I was already there
'Cause the walls start shaking, the Earth was quaking
My mind was aching and we were making it

I'm coding all night long
Yeah, I'm coding all night long

Working double time on the production line
She's one of a kind, she's just mine, all mine
Wanted no applause, it's just another course
Made a meal outta me, and come back for more

cool processor down to take me up the cloud 0
Now I'm back in the ring to take another swing
That the walls were shaking, the Earth was quaking
My mind was aching and we were making it

And I'm coding all night long
Yeah, I'm coding all night long
