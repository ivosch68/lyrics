Refrain:
Well.....okay.....Enough Internet today
Well...okay...thats too much internet today


Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin
are licking penis-shaped ice cream
And they have nothing on except lether pants

What could be disturbing about it 
when you watch a lemon party
Every *change in live can be a second chance

Grumpy Cat doesn't like nagging
But dogs enjoy tea bagging
Strange photoshop images, i saw them all


God Dammit whats wrong with people
Riding round with the rest of the beatles
Whole world must consit of trolls
