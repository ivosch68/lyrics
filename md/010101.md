#### Verse 1

Me and my mates are out tonight – what mates
Okay, me and myself stay home tonight – okay
I got a new game downloaded from stream provider  
And I opened the diet coke and decided  
That it's far to stressful to get out

#### Verse 2

Bruisings on my fingertips – ay ay
Funny jokes shot from the hips – you lie
Okay I'm just hanging around have no breather
Don't have to care about the weather,  
Outside, cause CPU keeps me warm  

#### Refrain

Nerd boys, nerd girls! - One! One! One! Twenty-one! - Unite!
Nerd boys, nerd girls! - One! One! One! Twenty-one! - Alright!

#### Verse 3

I's true, I have a lot of friends – online
Gaming makes a lot of sense – each night
I try hard again and again  
Dopamine runs through my veins
We love to be who we are

#### Refrain

Nerd boys, nerd girls! - One! One! One! Twenty-one! - Unite!
Nerd boys, nerd girls! - One! One! One! Twenty-one! - Alright!

#### Verse 4

Me and my girl have fun tonight – what girl
Okay, me and my hand have fun tonight – good whirl

#### Refrain

Nerd boys, nerd girls! - One! One! One! Twenty-one! - Unite!
Nerd boys, nerd girls! - One! One! One! Twenty-one! - Alright!
