# Enough Internet Today

#### Refrain

Well ... okay ... Enough Internet today  
Well ... okay ... thats too much internet today

#### Strophe

Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin  
are licking penis-shaped ice cream  
And they have nothing on except leather pants

What could be disturbing about it  
when you watch a lemon party  
Every *change in live can be a second chance

Grumpy Cat doesn't like nagging  
But dogs enjoy tea bagging  
Strange photoshop images, i saw them all

God dammit whats wrong with people  
Riding round with the rest of the beatles
Whole world must consist of trolls
