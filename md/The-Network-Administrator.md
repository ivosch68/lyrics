# Network Administrator  

#### Strophe

He played alone, never with other kids  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the network administrator  
He was more interested in Bytes and Bits  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was like the Terminator  
He was the best in all science classes  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He acted like a bad dictator  
He can see sharp (C#) but he has to wear glasses  

#### Refrain  

All files are deleted, everything is gone  
The admin rampage is finally done  

#### Strophe

Everything deleted, not one file was left  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the network administrator  
First you thought it was a data theft  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was like the Terminator  
Wifi down, and all servers shut  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He acted like a bad dictator  
You start your machine and your wallpaper shows a butt  
  
#### Refrain  

All files are deleted, everything is gone  
The admin rampage is finally done  

#### Strophe

He got your whole world, in his hands  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the network administrator  
You beg him for a second chance  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was like the Terminator  
Better be nice to the nerds outside  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He acted like a bad dictator  
Better be nice to the nerds world wide  

#### Refrain  

All files are deleted, everything is gone  
The admin rampage is finally done
