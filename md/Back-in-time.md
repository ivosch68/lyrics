# Back in Time

#### Verse

It was in late nineteen eighty five,  
When a young guy and his doctor took a drive  
At the Twin Pine Mall in the parking lot  
There came bad guys and there was a shot

So that was the end  
Of Emmet Brown  
Adventure began  
For Marty McFly

So, the doctor had a fancy car  
And he thought he will be a science star

He showed Marty what his car can do  
And Marty was blown out off his shoe

It's a time machine  
In a fancy car

It can travel in time  
when you are fast enough

#### Refrain

Back in Time, flames on the street  
Back in Time, and ice on the car  
Back in Time, it's a time machine

#### Verse

It was in late nineteen fifty-five  
When a farm-boy saw him arrive  
He had a visit at the twin pine farm  
He drove straight into the farmers barn

Flames on the street  
And ice on the car  
Marty drove away  
But he hit a pine

One point twenty-one gigawatt  
Tommy Addison, this is a lot

Marty planned his travel back with Doc Brown  
There was a lightning and a clock in town  

If you wanna go back  
You will need some help

Eighty-eight miles  
And a lightning bolt

#### Refrain

Back in Time, flames on the street  
Back in Time, and ice on the car  
Back in Time, it's a time machine
