# Back in Time

#### Verse

It was in late nineteen eighty five,  
when a young Guy and his doctor took a drive  
At the Twin Pine Mall in the parking lot  
There came bad guys and there was a shot

So that was the end  
of Emmet Brown  
Adventure began  
for Marty McFly

The Doctor had a fancy car  
and he thought he will be a science star

He showed Marty what his car can do  
And Marty was blown out off his shoe

Its a time machine  
In a fancy car

It can travel in time  
when you are fast enough

#### Refrain

Back in Time, Flames on the street  
Back in Time, and Ice on the car  
Back in Time, Its a time machine

#### Verse

It was in late nineteen fifty-five  
when a farm-boy saw him arrive  
he had a visit at the twin pine farm  
he drove straight into the farmers barn

Flames on the street  
and Ice on the car  
Marty drove away  
But he hit a pine

one point twenty-one gigawatt  
Tommy Addison, this is a lot

Marty planned his travel back with young DocBrown  
There was a lightning and a clock in town  

If you wanna go back  
you will need some help

eighty-eight miles  
and a lightning bolt

#### Refrain

Back in Time  
Flames on the street

Back in Time  
and Ice on the car

Back in Time  
It's a time machine
