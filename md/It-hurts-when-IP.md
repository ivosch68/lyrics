# It hurts when IP

#### Verse 1

One-twenty-seven, zero, zero, one  
Is my home IP  
This is my little private place  
Where I want to be  

External access, everything  
Was working great for me  
Then they changed to version six  
And everything - changed for me

#### Refrain

A lot of numbers, a lot of points  
Ipconfig is telling you  
A lot of numbers, a lot of points  

#### Verse 2

I tear down walls, I open ports  
No bit is coming through  
I ping my site, I ping the host  
I don't know what to do  

WiFi's working, providers's jerking  
I listen to their speech  
You have to get a dual stack  
Or this site cannot be reached

#### Refrain

A lot of numbers, a lot of points  
Ipconfig is telling you  
A lot of numbers, a lot of points  

#### Verse 3

No, I don't care what they say  
I do my own thing  
I hit the keys, I plague the mouse  
In speed of lightning  

Shiver your dual stack up your ass  
You stupid son of a bitch  
I did it on my own without  
A single switch

#### Refrain

A lot of numbers, a lot of points  
Ipconfig is telling you  
A lot of numbers, a lot of points  

It hurts - A lot of numbers, a lot of points  
It hurts - Ipconfig is telling you  
It hurts - A lot of numbers, a lot of points  
It hurts - When IP
