# It hurts when IP

#### Strophe 1

One, twenty-seven, zero, zero, one  
is my home IP  
this is my little  private place  
where i want to be  

external access, everything  
was working great for me  
then they changed to version six  
and everything - changed for me

#### Refrain

(It hurts) A lot of numbers, a lot of points  
(It hurts) ipconfig is telling you  
(It hurts) A lot of numbers, a lot of points  
(It hurts) It hurts when IP

#### Strophe 2

I tear down walls, I open ports  
No Bit is coming through  
I ping my site, I ping the host  
I don't know what to do  

WiFi's working, Providers`s jerking  
I listen to their speech  
You have to get a Dual Stack  
or this site cannot be reached

#### Refrain (2x)

(It hurts) A lot of numbers, a lot of points  
(It hurts) ipconfig is telling you  
(It hurts) A lot of numbers, a lot of points  
(It hurts) It hurts when IP

#### Strophe 3

No, I don't care what they say  
I do my own thing  
I hit the keys, I plague the mouse  
in speed of lightning  

Shiver your Dual Stack up your ass  
you stupid son of a bitch  
I did it on my own without  
a single switch
