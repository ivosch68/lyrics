They came from outta space  
Cool clothes and round house kicks

#### Verse

Their mighty leader is ninjesus  
He's the prophet of all ninjas, oh yes he is  
Throwing stars, bad ones get kicks  
He plays guitar and kicks the licks  
  
There are two more, it's thor and jones  
One plays with lightning, the other with bones  
Here is my big bang theory  
They are the heroes they need to be  
  
#### Bridge

Darth Vader, straight from the Enterprise  
With his famous horse, everybody recognize  
  
#### Refrain  

Heroes come and heroes go  
But everything you need to know  
This team is super hard as shit  
The villains are afraid of it  
  
Heroes come and heroes go  
But everything you need to know  
This team is super hard as shit  
The villains are afraid of it  
  
#### Verse

One evil guy is skeletor  
He has much power, but he wants more  
He sets up a trap, sure he is so bad  
Angry sharks with fucking lasers on their head  
  
Here comes the endboss  
The one with his stupid cross  
Who rides through the streets with his fancy car  
It's  H. I. T. L. E. R.  
  
#### Bridge

One punch, one kick, one nunchucku  
The heroes win, I think you too?  
The bad guys are some racist scum  
Kick their ass, don't be so dump  
  
#### Refrain  

Heroes come and heroes go  
But everything you need to know  
This team is super hard as shit  
The villains are afraid of it  
  
Heroes come and heroes go  
But everything you need to know  
This team is super hard as shit  
The villains are afraid of it
