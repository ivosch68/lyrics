# Cookies all Around

#### Strophe

It's the most wonderful time of the day  
Hang my self into the web  
Have to wait the 56K  
Load the pages bit by bit

These were the days when all the  
web was polite and honest  
Nothing but the truth was yet to load

Now that data-privacy eats  
Fucking UX for breakfast  
There's only kitten and memes on speed

#### Refrain

Cookies all around me  
Opt in Opt out yeah  
Cookies all around

#### Strophe

It's the most wonderful time of the day  
Scrolling towards timelines end  
New definition of infinity  
Repeating post no relevance

Bits and bytes became gossip  
Information bubble  
Nothing new nothing to see

Algorithms feed me  
On the breast of social  
Trolling 'round the christmas tree
