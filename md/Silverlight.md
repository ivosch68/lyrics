# Silverlight (My Computer Valentine)

#### Verse 1

The light was bright, it was alright  
I totally loved Silverlight  
Plugin needed, install succeeded  
But one day it was defeated  

Draw the site, moved a byte  
All the code I had to write  
Debugging was also fine  
Oh my computer valentine  

#### Verse 2

12th october 21  
All was done, and you were gone  
"End of life" as headline  
Oh my computer valentine  

#### Bridge

And I need you now  
I need you now somehow  
On my knees, I beg you please,  
Bring back my Silverlight  

#### Refrain

Come on baby, don't say may, - Come back to me my Silverlight  
Come on honey, want no money - Come back to me my Silverlight  
Oh my Darling, I am falling - Come back to me my Silverlight  

Hey my sweetheart, my heart beats hard - World Wide Web is waiting for you now  

#### Verse 3

As junior software engineer  
I loved UI and lots of beer  
Dotnet was my precious tool  
I learned it in my old high school  

I found you or you found me  
You were my UI master key  
I'm sitting dreaming on the Rhine  
Oh my computer valentine  

#### Bridge

And I need you now  
I need you now somehow  
On my knees, I beg you please,  
Bring back my Silverlight  

#### Refrain

Come on baby, don't say may, - Come back to me my Silverlight  
Come on honey, want no money - Come back to me my Silverlight  
Oh my Darling, I am falling - Come back to me my Silverlight  

Hey my sweetheart, my heart beats hard - World Wide Web is waiting for you now
