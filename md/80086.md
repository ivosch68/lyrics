# 80086

#### Refrain

16 Bit – My first love was an 8086

#### Verse

No floating operations  
Intel spread across the nations  
Right into our living room  
NASA flew it to the moon

Max of 64KB  - Memory  
Played Cats and other games  
CGA offered playing games in pink and blue  
PC for me and you
