# Back in Time Part 2

#### Verse 1

A flash, a boom, back in his room,  
His parents cool  
His car an awesome power tool  
Oh Yeah  
There's the doc, he brings a shock  
Fate ahead  
For your son the prison waits  
Oh no  

#### Bridge 1

Sport results of fifty years  
Lock the car or biff appears  
Problems solved, now back in time  
But everything will change from here  

#### Refrain

Future, Past, Present Tense - Back in Time  
Don't play with time, it's commonsense - Back in Time  
Now your journey has begun - Back in Time  
You have to save your loved one - Back in Time  

#### Verse 2

They changed a thing, now Trump is king  
Control-Z  
Go back to nineteen fifty-five  
Oh Yeah  
Calvin talks, Marty rocks  
Do not meet  
Beware of all time paradox  
Oh no  

#### Bridge 2

Biff was here and that was clear  
Almanacs will disappear  
Again a lightning while he drives  
Go back to eighteen fifty-five  

#### Refrain

Now your journey has begun - Back in Time  
You have to save your loved one - Back in Time
