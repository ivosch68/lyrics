# (Never change a) Running System

#### Verse

You have a running system and it's always fine and okay  
But your boss told you to change it anyway

So you have to change and it is a bad idea  
So you made a change and it was bad idea

There is no problem, but perhaps its not so nice  
Your boss asked you now more than twice

So you have to change and it is a bad idea  
So you made a change and it was bad idea

#### Bridge

It is fucked up and you work til dawn  
The system crashed and your weekend's gone  
With a change the bugs will spawn

Do it rare  
And do it with care  
Otherwise you repair

#### Refrain

Your running system  
Your running system  
Your running system  

#### Verse

Now you search for docs and you search for all the logs  
But all you find are outdated blogs

So you have to change and it is a bad idea  
So you made a change and it was bad idea

You have not idea what you are doing here  
time is running and you feel the smell of fear

So you have to change and it is a bad idea  
So you made a change and it was bad idea

#### Bridge

It is fucked up and you work til dawn  
The system crashed and your weekend`s gone  
With a change the bugs will spawn

Do it rare  
And do it with care  
Otherwise you repair

#### Refrain

Your running system  
Your running system  
Your running system  

Your running system  
Your running system  
Your running system
