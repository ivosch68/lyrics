# Support Call

#### Strophe

Hi, is there the support hotline - aha  
I got a problem with a laptop of mine - aha  
It shuts down every now and then - aha  
I tried a lot already but it’s doing it again - aha  
  
I checked the internet and I found a few - aha  
suggestions how to fix it and some “how to”s - aha  
I found the registry I felt like a hacker or so - aha  
But nothing solved it since it happened two weeks ago  
  
#### Refrain

Switch off, Switch on! It works!  
Problem sits in front of the screen  
Switch off, Switch on! It works!  
Working with a windows machine  

#### Strophe

Hey, can you please try to help remote? - aha  
What you mean I have to strike the note? - aha  
Please, please I will do what you say – aha  
You will be my hero for – one day - Yeah  

Did you say I have to switch it off? - aha  
But now I can't see really a lot – aha  
The reboot starts and the system seems brand new - aha  
Are you someone from the informatics crew? - Yeah  

#### Refrain

Switch off, Switch on! It works!  
Problem sits in front of the screen  
Switch off, Switch on! It works!  
Working with a windows machine
