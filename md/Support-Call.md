# Support Call

(available on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/qgszVPFk-Us))

#### Verse 1

Hi, is there the support hotline - aha  
I got a problem with a laptop of mine - aha  
It shuts down every now and then - aha  
I tried a lot already, but it’s doing it again
  
I checked the internet and I found a few - aha  
Suggestions how to fix it and some how-tos - aha  
I found the registry I felt like a hacker or so  
But nothing solved it since it happened two weeks ago  
  
#### Refrain

Switch off, Switch on! It works!  
Problem sits in front of the screen  
Switch off, Switch on! It works!  
Working with a windows machine  

#### Verse 2

Hey, can you please try to help remote? - aha  
What you mean I have to strike the note? - aha  
Please, please I will do what you say  
You will be my hero for – one day  

Did you say I have to switch it off? - aha  
But now I can't see really a lot – aha  
The reboot starts and the system seems brand new  
Are you someone from the informatics crew?  

#### Refrain

Switch off, Switch on! It works!  
Problem sits in front of the screen  
Switch off, Switch on! It works!  
Working with a windows machine
