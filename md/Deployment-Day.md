## :warning: draft version  

# Deployment Day

#### Verse 1

All the stress and all the bugs, pop-up every two weeks  
Memory leaks, performance peaks, fuck this modern techniques  

Sprint is over, demo planned, and you are still awake  
Nervous shake, pipelines break, again a stupid mistake  

#### Refrain

Prod release is even worse, it feels like doomsday  
Welcome to Deployment Day  

#### Bridge

Review tomorrow, all the pressure today
Yeah, it is again deployment day

Strophe 1

Refrain 2x

Some sprints are done, the final run, we are not finished yet
bet








feature is not finished yet
okay, anyway
Managers say 
Release it today!




 
They will come to you
There is a security breakthrouh

You are from the DevOps Crew
You fix like you know Kung Fu


It is deployment day
You have to fix it today


Deployment broken baby,
Perhaps it is the code, maybe


Congrats, you made it all the way
