# Passion Coder

#### Verse

Your the reason for this text and for this chord  
Remember when it all began  
Learned from failures scratched head and start debugging  
Again and again

First lines in my IDE - I thought I did it  
On first take  
But truth got me by the balls; it crashed production  
For god's sake

#### Refrain

Be my permanent marker on the white board  
Be my cast or an infinite loop  
Be my memory out of bound exception  
Be my blue screen of death - yeah - I need you

#### Verse

CI/CD is just for loosers when you code  
on the productive side of life  
Fucked it up not only once  
It was not me, who paid the price

#### Refrain

Be my permanent marker on the white board  
Be my cast or an infinite loop  
Be my memory out of bounds exception  
Be my blue screen of death - yeah - I need you

Be my permanent marker on the white board  
Be my cast or an infinite loop  
Be my memory out of bounds exception  
Be my blue screen of death - yeah - I need you

We travel through time and space  
With code I'm writing now
