# Coding all Night Long

#### Verse

She was a fast machine, she kept her memory clean  
She had the best damn cpu that I ever seen  
She had the sightless eyes, telling me no lies  
Knocking me out with those American thighs

Taking more than her share, had me fighting for air  
She told me to come, but I was already there  
'Cause the walls start shaking, the Earth was quaking  
My mind was aching and we were making it

#### Refrain

I'm coding all night long  
Yeah, I'm coding all night long

#### Verse

Working double time on the production line  
She's one of a kind, she's just mine, all mine  
Wanted no applause, it's just another course  
Made a meal outta me, and come back for more

cool processor down to take me up the cloud 0  
Now I'm back in the ring to take another swing  
That the walls were shaking, the Earth was quaking  
My mind was aching and we were making it

#### Refrain

And I'm coding all night long  
Yeah, I'm coding all night long
