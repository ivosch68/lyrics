# Summer in the Basement
  
#### Verse 1

The summer starts and the weather's nice, everybody's going out  
Meeting friends and having fun, thats what it is all about  
Sitting in the sun and feeling how your skin gets brown  
Hang around at the beach and some tits are also shown  
  
There are a barbecues at the backyards, but you will never go there  
You go down in your basement and close the curtains everywhere  
Sure, you have friends and you are also good at school  
But the sun is too hot, and you are not a fool  
  
#### Refrain

Sun is shining, nights are warm but this is not for you  
Summer in the Basement  
  
All your friends are having fun, and celebrate their lives  
Summer in the Basement  
  
#### Verse 2
  
It's too warm, you are sweating fast, why should you go out in the heat,  
In your basement it's cold, and here - you have everything you need  
Fast food, snacks and your high end PC is cooling down,  
Your mom brings you food and stuff, your seat looks like a throne  
  
Why should you fly for hours to other countries and poison in the air  
When you can start your machine and go right everywhere  
You will travel, visit deserts, hills and cities, too  
It will be a great adventure, where you go, you need no shoes  

#### Refrain

Sun is shining, nights are warm but this is not for you  
Summer in the Basement  
  
All your friends are having fun, and celebrate their lives  
Summer in the Basement
