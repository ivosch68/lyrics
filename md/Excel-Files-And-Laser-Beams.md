# Excel Files & Laser Beams (My Colleague Is A Robot)

#### Refrain

Excel files and laser beams  
Nothing he can't do, it seems  
My colleague, he is new and a machine  

Excel files and laser beams  
Nothing he can't do, it seems  
My colleague, he is new and a machine  

#### Verse 1

Yes, robots are pretty cool  
But he makes me look like a fool  
Automation here, processing there  
It feels like he is everywhere  

Fifteen colleagues already gone  
'Cause there is this new one  
From nine to five and five to nine  
I should pull his power line  

#### Refrain

Excel files and laser beams  
Nothing he can't do, it seems  
My colleague, he is new and a machine  

Excel files and laser beams  
Nothing he can't do, it seems  
My colleague, he is new and a machine  

#### Bridge

Robot Dance, I have no chance  
Calculations are bad situations  
And arm wrestling, embarrassing!  
I hate this fucking thing!  

#### Verse 2

Antennas are now everywhere  
My problems, he is unaware  
Looked at me with his blank face  
Where did he come, I think from space  

My boss ask me if I am free  
I think he wants to fire me  
Next to my desk a new big box  
My job is gone, oh man that sucks  

#### Refrain

Excel files and laser beams  
Nothing he can't do, it seems  
My colleague, he is new and a machine  

Excel files and laser beams  
Nothing he can't do, it seems  
My colleague, he is new and a machine  

Excel files and laser beams  
Nothing he can't do, it seems  
My colleague, he is new and a machine  

Excel files and laser beams  
Nothing he can't do, it seems  
My colleague, he is new and a machine
